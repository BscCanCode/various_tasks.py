## About This Project
A beginner-friendly tool with basic Python features:

- Conditionals
- Loops
- Try-Except
- User Input Handling  

---

## Why I Built This
- Wanted to experiment with simple logic tasks without tutorials.
- Practiced if-else, loops, and error handling.
- No advanced features yet, just learning step-by-step.

---

## How to Run
1. Save as `various_tasks.py`.
2. Run with `python various_tasks.py` in your terminal.

---

## Features (Basic)
|Feature|What It Does|
|-------|------------|
|Check Even/Odd|Determines if a number is even or odd|
|Check Greater No.|Compares two numbers|
|Check Voting|Confirms if age allows voting (>=18)|
|Tables|Shows multiplication table for a number|
|Exit|Closes the program|

## What can program do:
1. Check Even/Odd
2. Check Greater No.
3. Check if you can vote?
4. Tables
5. Exit

## Sample Flow
- Choose 1 → Enter 4 → "4 is an even number"
- Choose 2 → Enter 5, 3 → "5 is greater than 3"
- Choose 3 → Enter 20 → "Ofcourse you can vote!"
- Choose 4 → Enter 2 → "2 x 0 = 0" ... "2 x 10 = 20"
- Choose 5 → Exit
